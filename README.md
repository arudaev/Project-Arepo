## Project Description

**Project Apero** provides an intuitive interface for users to input personal health metrics—such as age, gender, BMI, blood glucose levels, etc.—and receive an estimated probability of experiencing a stroke. It then offers evidence-based recommendations and insights to help reduce stroke risk.

The application is built using:
- **Streamlit** for the web front end
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning model training and prediction
- **Rasa** for an integrated chatbot
- **Docker** for containerization and ease of deployment

> **Why "Apero"?**  
> The project name is derived from a playful acronym referencing a healthy approach to “Assessing Personal Event Risks Online,” aiming to make preventative health measures more approachable.

## Key Features

1. **Personalized Stroke Risk Assessment**
   - **Input Health Metrics**: Users provide personal data (e.g., age, gender, BMI, blood glucose levels, and more).
   - **Risk Probability**: The machine learning model calculates a stroke risk score (0.0 to 1.0).
   - **Actionable Recommendations**: Users receive suggestions tailored to their risk factors.

2. **Interactive Data Analysis & Visualization**
   - **Data Exploration**: Filter and explore health-related metrics to reveal trends and correlations.
   - **Visual Insights**: Interactive charts, heatmaps, and summary statistics enhance comprehension of stroke risk factors.

3. **Conversational Chatbot Assistance**
   - **Real-Time Queries**: A Rasa-powered chatbot answers questions about stroke risk, data insights, and wellness tips.
   - **Guided Interaction**: The chatbot can direct users to relevant pages, simplify data analysis steps, and deliver personalized feedback.

4. **Robust Data Handling and Augmentation**
   - **Outlier Detection**: Statistical methods to detect and remove anomalies.
   - **Synthetic Data Generation**: Augments the dataset by ~30% to improve model performance and generalization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**  
  Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed and running on your machine.
- **Git**  
  Required to clone the repository.
- **Python 3.9+ (Optional)**  
  If you want to run or modify components without Docker.

### Steps to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arudaev/Project-Arepo.git
   cd Project-Arepo
   ```

2. **Build and Run Docker Services**  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   - This command builds Docker images, trains machine learning models, and starts all necessary services.
   - The initial startup may take several minutes as the environment sets up.

3. **Access the Web Application**  
   - Open a web browser and go to: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
   - You will see the main page with navigation options for data analysis, personalized recommendations, and chatbot interaction.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to run or modify components without Docker, refer to the comments in the `docker-compose.yml` or optional instructions in the [`docs/`](./docs) folder (if provided).

### Training the Rasa Chatbot (Optional)

If you make changes to the chatbot’s training data or if the chatbot fails to respond:

1. **Open a terminal inside the Rasa server container**  
   ```bash
   docker exec -it rasa_server bash
   ```

2. **Train the Rasa Model**  
   ```bash
   rasa train
   ```

3. **Restart Services**  
   ```bash
   exit
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

## Data Overview

### Dataset

We utilize the publicly available [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). This dataset includes key health metrics:

- Age, BMI, Glucose Levels
- Hypertension, Heart Disease
- Smoking Status, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> This dataset is used strictly for educational and demonstration purposes.

### Data Handling and Augmentation

- **Outlier Detection**: Employs a Z-score based method to filter anomalous data points.
- **Synthetic Data Augmentation**: Adds ~30% realistic synthetic data to boost model robustness and representation.
- **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features are normalized or standardized, aligning with best practices from [Google’s ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course).

---

## Usage

### Personalized Stroke Risk Assessment

1. **Navigate to "Personalized Recommendations"**  
   From the sidebar, select **Personalized Recommendations**.

2. **Provide Personal Health Metrics**  
   Enter details such as age, gender, BMI, glucose levels, hypertension status, etc.

3. **Receive Risk Probability & Recommendations**  
   The system displays a **stroke risk** (0.0 to 1.0) and personalized tips (e.g., diet, exercise, medical follow-up).

### Interactive Data Analysis

1. **Go to "Data Analysis"**  
   Choose **Data Analysis** from the sidebar.

2. **Explore and Visualize**  
   - Filter or query the dataset to inspect correlations and distributions.  
   - View generated charts, tables, or heatmaps.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   Train or re-train the underlying machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) within the app. Evaluate performance via metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, etc.

### Chatbot Assistance

1. **Select "Chatbot"**  
   Click on **Chatbot** in the sidebar to open the conversational assistant interface.

2. **Interact with the Rasa-Powered Chatbot**  
   - Ask questions about stroke risk or how to interpret certain metrics.  
   - Get immediate recommendations and clarifications on data analysis results.
